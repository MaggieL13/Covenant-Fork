 * goal is "sensible and cheap by default" — not "secretly expensive."
 * Heavier values (`xhigh`, `max`) stay available as explicit opt-ins
 * for users who want the big-brain firepower.
 *
 * Lives in `shared/` because both the backend (config resolution at
 * the SDK call site) and the frontend (Settings dropdown showing
 * "Auto resolves to: Chat X → high · Autonomous Y → high") need to
 * agree on the table. Keeps the displayed values matching what the
 * backend actually sends.
